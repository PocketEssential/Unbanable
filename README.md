# Unbannable
This is a simple plugin that blocks players you specify in the config from being banned by anyone. You will most likely never need this, but is intended as an extra safeguard in the event of a player using a back door or exploit to op themselves.

No commands or perms! Just pop in the plugin, load up your server, and edit the config!
